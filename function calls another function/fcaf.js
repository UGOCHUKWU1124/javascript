//functions with no arguments and no return value 
//calling showCountry function into showCity function
function showCity() 
  // instead of saying let showCity = function() then return in the normal

//EXAMPLE 2
//CALL FUNCTION INSIDE ANOTHER FUNCTION.....SQUARE FUNCTION IS CALLED INTO CUBE
// everything here basically is equal to square(n)
let square = function(n) 
{
return n*n;
}
// everything here basically is equal to cube(n)
let cube = function(n)
{
    return square(n)*n;
} 
let result = cube(5);
console.log(result);
//OR without assigning a variable
console.log (cube(4));

/*SQUARE IS THE SMALLER TASK AND CUBE IS THE LARGER TASK 
THEREFORE SMALLER TASK IS CALLED INTO LARGER TASK */
